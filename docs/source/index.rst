hdfs3
=====

This project is not undergoing development
------------------------------------------

Pyarrow's JNI `hdfs interface`_ is mature and stable. It also has fewer problems
with configuration and various security settings, and does not require the complex
build process of libhdfs3. Therefore, all users who have trouble with hdfs3 are
recommended to try pyarrow.

Introduction
------------

Use HDFS natively from Python.

The `Hadoop File System`_ (HDFS) is a widely deployed, distributed, data-local
file system written in Java.  This file system backs most clusters running
Hadoop and Spark.

Pivotal produced libhdfs3_, an alternative native C/C++ HDFS client that
interacts with HDFS without the JVM, exposing first class support to non-JVM
languages like Python.

This library, ``hdfs3``, is a lightweight Python wrapper around the C/C++
``libhdfs3`` library.  It provides both direct access to libhdfs3 from Python
as well as a typical Pythonic interface.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from hdfs3 import HDFileSystem
   >>> hdfs = HDFileSystem(host='localhost', port=8020)
   >>> hdfs.ls('/user/data')
   >>> hdfs.put('local-file.txt', '/user/data/remote-file.txt')
   >>> hdfs.cp('/user/data/file.txt', '/user2/data')

HDFS3 files comply with the Python File interface. This enables interactions
with the broader ecosystem of PyData projects.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> with hdfs.open('/user/data/file.txt') as f:
   ...     data = f.read(1000000)

   >>> with hdfs.open('/user/data/file.csv.gz') as f:
   ...     df = pandas.read_csv(f, compression='gzip', nrows=1000)


Motivation
----------

We choose to use an alternative C/C++/Python HDFS client rather than the
default JVM client for the following reasons:

*  **Convenience:** Interactions between Java libraries and Native
   (C/C++/Python) libraries can be cumbersome.  Using a native library from
   Python smoothes over the experience in development, maintenance, and
   debugging.
*  **Performance:** Native libraries like ``libhdfs3`` do not suffer the long JVM
   startup times, improving interaction.
